#### Introduction

PopRemote is a simple but powerful remote application for the popular **[Popcorn-Time](https://popcorntime.io)** video plattform. Currently, it is known to work with **Popcorn-Time-0.3.7.2**.

In order to provide a flexible way for everyone to build their own version, I decided to focus on the web application. That leaves the decision on how to run it to the educated reader. I am currently running this on my local Mac Mini server that also hosts Popcorn Time with the help of **[http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)** but anyone could use the known **[Ionic](http://ionicframework.com)** functions to turn this easily into a native app.

Since popremote is build as a modern web application, the simplest way to use it is to have some sort of web server that hosts the content and then, on your phone, to save a shortcut to your phones home screen. That will work on iOS and on Android, you can use Chrome to do the same. That way, you will get a nice icon and a fullscreen experience too.
