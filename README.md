#### Introduction

PopRemote is a simple but powerful remote application for the popular [Popcorn-Time](https://popcorntime.io) video plattform. Currently, it is known to work with **Popcorn-Time-0.3.7.2**.

In order to provide a flexible way for everyone to build their own version, I decided to focus on the web application. That leaves the decision on how to run it to the educated reader. I am currently running this on my local Mac Mini server that also hosts Popcorn Time with the help of [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server).

Since popremote is build as a modern web application, the simplest way to use it is to have some sort of web server that hosts the content and then, on your phone, to save a shortcut to your phones home screen. That will work on iOS and on Android, you can use Chrome to do the same. That way, you will get a nice icon and a fullscreen experience too.
